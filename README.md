WEB 250 Guilford Technical Community College Final Project

This project was supposed to be more detailed, however the class ran out of time to implement every aspect that we wanted.  It mostly displays how to create a sign up form using HTML and PHP, and how users can login after signing up.  To properly run this site you must use XAMPP.  You can run the HTML files in a browser however the PHP files will not display.  This project uses PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, MySQL, and XAMPP.
