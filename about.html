			<p class="aboutStory">Runtopia was born from a mission to be better.  The founder of Runtopia, Jacob Baynes, was not a runner until the of age 30.  When he realized how much exercise, especially running, can help calm the mind and focus his attention, he committed to running his first half-marathon.<br><br>
			Through training for his first half, Jacob motivated his brother to join him, and they spent 18 weeks running 5 days a week to prepare for race day.  Training is never easy, but it seems to make other aspects of life easier.  When a person puts themselves in difficult situations, especially where they can control the difficulty, they learn how they can handle being uncomfortable or tired or even scared.  The first few weeks of training was filled with stomach cramps from anxiety, shin splints, and raw skin.  Jacob and his brother slowly gained strength and confidence as the weeks went by.  Finally race day came and went and they finished right at two hours and left feeling happy and accomplished with their new race medals.<br><br>
			Life is full of difficulties.  Experience helps us handle those difficulties.  Finding that thing in life that keeps you balanced and moving forward is crucial to happiness.  For a lot of people running is a form of meditation.  It helps wash away stress and lets us release.  Having the right shoes and apparel is important and we hope you use Runtopia.com for all your running needs.</p>
